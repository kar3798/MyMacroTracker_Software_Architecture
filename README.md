# MyMacroTracker_Software_Architecture

Repo for managing the project deliverables for SE577.

## Deliverable 1: Press Release + FAQ

This deliverable follows the Amazon "Working Backwards" approach. It includes:

- A one-page press release announcing *MyMacroTracker*, a cross-platform meal planning and macro tracking app designed for fitness-focused users.
- A set of FAQs (3 external, 3 internal) addressing key questions from users and stakeholders.

The goal is to define the product vision from a customer-first perspective before technical development begins.
